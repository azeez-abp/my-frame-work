In C programming, there are several fundamental data types that you can use to define variables and store different kinds of values. Here's a list of the basic data types in C:

Integers:

int: Integer type.
short: Short integer type.
long: Long integer type.
long long: Long long integer type (C99 and later).
signed: Signed integer type (default).
unsigned: Unsigned integer type.

Floating-Point Numbers:
float: Single-precision floating-point type.
double: Double-precision floating-point type.
long double: Extended-precision floating-point type.
Characters:

Double is used for storing floating-point values up to a higher precision than float, 
whereas long is used only for storing large integer value up to a higher precision than int.


char: Character type.

Pointers:
int*: Pointer to an integer.
char*: Pointer to a character.
void*: Generic pointer type.
Pointer types for other data types as well.

The pointer stores the memory address of the value to which it points

Arrays:
int[]: Array of integers.
char[]: Array of characters.
Arrays of other data types as well.

Array  data is stored in sequential order, the memory addresses have common difference

Enumerations:
enum: Enumerated data type.

Derived Data Types:
struct: Structure type to group different data types.
union: Union type to store multiple data types in the same memory location.
typedef: Create aliases for existing data types.

Boolean:
_Bool: Boolean data type introduced in C99.

Size Types:
size_t: Used to represent sizes of objects (e.g., returned by the sizeof operator).
ptrdiff_t: Used to represent the difference between two pointers.
size_t = long unsigned int  size type

Wide Characters (for Unicode):
wchar_t: Wide character type.
These are some of the basic data types in C. Keep in mind that C allows you to create user-defined data types using struct and union, and you can also use typedef to create aliases for existing types, which can make your code more readable and maintainable.

char 1 
short 2
int 4
long 8

float 4
double 8

Additionally, C99 introduced new data types such as bool, complex, and variable-length arrays (VLAs). However, their availability might depend on the compiler and the version of the C standard being used.

All these types are declear in body of a function

char* get_name(int id, char* name)
{
      
}

size_t getSize(void* input)
{
        char* input_val;
        input_val = (char* ) input;
        int count  = 0;
        void* (*f)(int a, char* b) function_name  = get_name;
        
        while ()


}
