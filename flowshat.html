	<p>
		Some good uses of flowcharts:

		Create a flowchart before coding a task to either help create or validate pseudo-code
		Add to a README.md to visually show how your project/process works
		Use in a presentation to aide audience understanding
		Your function or process is not working as expected? Create a flowchart of how it CURRENTLY is. Then, walk through the chart with some example input.
		A flowchart can be as high-level or as detailed as you want. For example, you could break the flowchart above down further to include what is happening in memory. You can even create flowcharts from your everyday non-technical experiences. Choosing a movie or a place to eat could be displayed as a flow-chart!

		A helpful tool to create flowcharts is draw.io. There are premade symbols for you to use and your diagrams can be saved to your Google Drive.

		For more information on Flowcharts and related diagrams, a google search with simply “flowchart” can get you

     	Technical Writing Basics
		You will write several blogs during your time as a student. Technical writing pieces are included in both project assignments and as extracurricular assignments from staff.

		The general requirements for all blogs are as follow:

		Have at least one picture at the top of the blog post
		Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn
		Share your blog post at least on LinkedIn
		Write professionally and intelligibly
		Explain every step/concept you know, and give examples – a total beginner should understand what you have written
		Please remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings
		Remember that future employers will see your articles; take your writing seriously and produce something that will be an asset to your future
		Blogs are manually reviewed by a staff member, a TA, or a peer and are evaluated on how well they meet the above requirements as well as specific requirements based on topic, which is listed in the associated project.

		This should go without saying, but plagiarism is unacceptable.

      	Technical Writing FAQ
		“Why are the blog instructions so vague? How do I know what to write about?”
		We do not outline all the requirements because part of these challenges is to teach/learn/experience how to find what needs to be said on a topic that’s new to you. You may not know what needs to be explained to a reader, but your research on the topic should help guide you.

		“If the blog should be understood by beginners, why is there an expectation of having in-depth explanations, even to the point of using jargon beginners may not understand?”
		Even if your audience is beginners, we must trust that they could understand a highly technical topic if it is explained well. Be sure to not only use appropriate jargon but to define the jargon you use. After reading your blog, the hope is that your audience will know the technical topic at the deepest level possible.

		“My reviewer scored me more strictly than others. Can’t we make this more standardized?”
		Each student is entrusted to score fairly and to the best of their ability. We understand that there may be a variance between how reviewers score, but it also reflects the interpretation and understanding of a general reader audience.

		“Can I write other technical blogs outside of school projects?”
		Of course! You’re encouraged to share them with staff and peers as well. If you’re interested in writing more but don’t know what to write about, here are some ideas:

		Keeping a devblog for big projects is a great way to document processes, successes, failures, and to-dos.
		If you find a framework, SDK, API, etc. has limited or confusing documentation, write a tutorial to help others with the problems that you’ve encountered.
