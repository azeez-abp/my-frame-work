`AAA\n\nAuthentication, Authorization and Accounting refers to a family of protocols that mediate network access including the RADIUS protocol.\n\nACL\n\nIn computer security, an Access-Control List (ACL) is a list of permissions associated with a system resource (object). An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.\n\nEach entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation. For instance, if a file object has an ACL that contains (Alice: read,write; Bob: read), this would give Alice permission to read and write the file and only give Bob permission to read it.\n\nAD\n\nActive Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. Initially, Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. However, Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.\n\nA server running the Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) role is called a domain controller. It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network. Assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Also, it allows management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services, Active Directory Federation Services, Lightweight Directory Services, and Rights Management Services.\n\nAdware\n\nMalware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user. In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer and monitors the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party.\n\nAir-Gapped Network\n\nAn air-gap, air wall, air gapping or disconnected network is a network security measure employed on one or more computers to ensure that a secure computer network is physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public Internet or an unsecured local area network. It means a computer or network has no network interfaces connected to other networks, with a physical or conceptual air gap, analogous to the air gap used in plumbing to maintain water quality.\n\nANSI/ISA\n\nIntenational standards from the International Society of Automation for developing automated interfaces between enterprise and control systems. The objectives of ISA-95 are to provide consistent terminology that is a foundation for supplier and manufacturer communications, to provide consistent information models, and to provide consistent operations models as a foundation for clarifying application functionality and how information is to be used. It consists of five models:\n\nISA-95.00.01-2000 Part 1: Models include standard terminology and object models, which can be used to decide which information should be exchanged and help to define boundaries between the enterprise systems and the control systems.\n\nANSI/ISA-95.00.02-2001 Part 2: Models consists of attributes for every object that is defined in part 1. The objects and attributes of Part 2 can be used for the exchange of information between different systems, but these objects and attributes can also be used as the basis for relational databases.\n\nANSI/ISA-95.00.03-2005 Part 3: Models of Manufacturing Operations Management focuses on the functions and activities at level 3 (Production / MES layer). It provides guidelines for describing and comparing the production levels of different sites in a standardized way.\n\nISA-95.00.04 Object Models & Attributes Part 4 of ISA-95: This technical specification defines object models that determine which information is exchanged between MES activities (which are defined in part 3 by ISA-95). The models and attributes from part 4 are the basis for the design and the implementation of interface standards and make sure of a flexible lapse of the cooperation and information-exchange between the different MES activities. It is still under development.\n\nISA-95.00.05 B2M Transactions Part 5 of ISA-95: This technical specification defines operation between office and production automations-systems, which can be used together with the object models out of part 1 & 2. The operations connect and organize the production objects and activities that are defined through earlier parts of the standard. Such operations take place on all levels within a business, but the focus of this technical specification lies on the interface between enterprise- and control systems. Based on models, the operation will be described and becomes the operation processing logically explained.\n\nAPI\n\nAn application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\n\nIn contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.\n\nOne purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change. An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems.\n\nWeb APIs allow communication between computers that are joined by the internet. This is the most common meaning of the term API today. There are also APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware. APIs originated in the 1940s, though the term did not emerge until the 1960s and 70s.\n\nAPT\n\nAdvanced Persistent Threats.\n\nArchive File\n\nAn archive file is a computer file that is composed of one or more files along with metadata. Archive files are used to collect multiple data files together into a single file for easier portability and storage, or simply to compress files to use less storage space. Archive files often store directory structures, error detection and correction information, arbitrary comments, and sometimes use built-in encryption.\n\nATP\n\nAdvanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a suite of analysis tools designed to defend against advanced threats that use known and unknown attack vectors. ATP augments more common security solutions aimed at repelling known intrusion strategies.\n\nAdvanced threats are those that seek to surreptitiously gain access to a network and remain, undetected, in that network for months or even years, exfiltrating large amounts of data, conducting espionage, and/or causing significant damage.\n\nAV\n\nAntivirus software, also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware.\n\nAV Definition\n\nTraditional antivirus software relies heavily upon signatures to identify malware. When malware arrives in the hands of an antivirus firm, it is analyzed by malware researchers or by dynamic analysis systems. Then, once it is determined to be a malware, a proper signature of the file is extracted and added to the signatures database of the antivirus software.\n\nAV Signature\n\nAV Signatures are known segments of a virus that an AV engine looks for to detect infection.\n\nBACnet\n\nBACnet is a communication protocol for Building Automation and Control (BAC) networks that leverage the ASHRAE, ANSI, and ISO 16484-5 standard protocol.\n\nBACnet was designed to allow communication of building automation and control systems for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control (HVAC), lighting control, access control, and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms for computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular building service they perform.\n\nBES\n\nBulk Electric System\n\nBIOS\n\nIn computing, BIOS is an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS, BIOS ROM or PC BIOS). It is firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first software to run when powered on. The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. The BIOS, originally proprietary to the IBM PC has been reverse engineered by some companies (such as Phoenix Technologies) looking to create compatible systems.\n\nThe BIOS in modern PCs initializes and tests the system hardware components, and loads a boot loader from a mass storage device which then initializes an operating system. In the era of DOS, the BIOS provided BIOS interrupt calls for the keyboard, display, storage, and other input/output (I/O) devices that standardized an interface to application programs and the operating system. More recent operating systems do not use the BIOS interrupt calls after startup.\n\nMost BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or motherboard model, by interfacing with various devices, especially the system chipset. Originally, BIOS firmware was stored in a ROM chip on the PC motherboard. In modern computer systems, the BIOS contents are stored on flash memory so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard. This allows easy, end-user updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS rootkits. Furthermore, a BIOS upgrade that fails may brick the motherboard.\n\nBitlocker\n\nBitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the Windows operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.\n\nBlack Hat Hacker\n\nThese individuals are knowledgeable computer experts with criminal intentions. They attack and gain access to systems to steal data or inflict damage.\n\nBlue Hat Hacker\n\nLike Script Kiddies, these hackers use hacking as a weapon to gain popularity and settle scores with adversaries.\n\nBot\n\na software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could. The most extensive use of bots is for web crawling, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers. More than half of all web traffic is generated by bots.\n\nBotnet\n\nA botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control software. The word "botnet" is a portmanteau of the words "robot" and "network". The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation.\n\nCASB\n\nCloud Access Security Broker is on-premises or cloud-based software that sits between cloud service users and cloud applications. It monitors all activity and enforces security policies. A CASB can offer a variety of services such as monitoring user activity, warning administrators about potentially hazardous actions, enforcing security policy compliance, and automatically preventing malware.\n\nCDR\n\nContent Disarm & Reconstruction is a computer security technology for removing potentially malicious code from files. Unlike malware analysis, CDR technology does not determine or detect malware's functionality but removes all file components that are not approved within the system's definitions and policies. It is used to prevent cyber security threats from entering a corporate network perimeter. Channels that CDR can be used to protect include email and website traffic. Advanced solutions can also provide similar protection on computer endpoints, or cloud email and file sharing services. There are three levels of CDR -\n\n1) flattening and converting the original file.\n\n2) stripping active content while keeping the original file type.\n\n3) eliminating all file-borne risk while maintaining file type, integrity and active content.\n\nChecksum\n\nA hash function that uses a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage. By themselves, checksums are often used to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data authenticity.\n\nCI\n\nCritical infrastructure describes the physical and cyber systems and assets that are so vital to the United States that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on our physical or economic security or public health or safety. The nation's critical infrastructure provides the essential services that underpin society.\n\nCI Sectors\n\nThere are 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof. Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21): Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience advances a national policy to strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure. This directive supersedes Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7.\n\nCIP\n\nCritical Infrastructure Protection includes a suite of security tools to harden and protect the critical infrastructure that encompass the computing and network systems that run the vast network of highways, connecting bridges and tunnels, railways, utilities and buildings necessary to maintain normalcy in daily life.\n\nCNC\n\nComputer Numerical Control is the automated control of machining tools (such as drills, lathes, mills and 3D printers) by means of a computer. A CNC machine processes a piece of material (metal, plastic, wood, ceramic, or composite) to meet specifications by following a coded programmed instruction and without a manual operator directly controlling the machining operation.\n\nA CNC machine is a motorized maneuverable tool and often a motorized maneuverable platform, which are both controlled by a computer, according to specific input instructions. Instructions are delivered to a CNC machine in the form of a sequential program of machine control instructions such as G-code and M-code, then executed. The program can be written by a person or, far more often, generated by graphical Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software and/or Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. In the case of 3D printers, the part to be printed is "sliced", before the instructions (or the program) is generated. 3D printers also use G-Code.\n\nCompliance\n\nThe running state of a device that is in accordance with configuration policies set by its governing organization.\n\nComputer Algorithm\n\nAn algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software, by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce output from given input.\n\nComputer Network\n\nA group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.\n\nCPU\n\nCentral Processing Unit, also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program.\n\nCVE\n\nCommon Volnerabilities and Exposures.\n\nCVSS\n\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System. The industry standard vulnerability scoring system that calculates scores based on the impact.\n\nCyberattack\n\nA Cyberattack is any attempt to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal or gain information through unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of a computing asset. It includes any offensive maneuver that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, or personal computer devices. An attacker is a person or process that attempts to access data, functions, or other restricted areas of the system without authorization, potentially with malicious intent.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity or Information Technology Security (IT Security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.\n\nDA Server\n\nData Access servers (DA servers) provide data from different data sources (for example, process control systems) that an OPC client (for example, SAP ODA) can read. At the same time, DA servers can receive data from an OPC client and process it. Thus, OPC servers enable accessing a large number of items from a large number of data sources (for example, process control systems).\n\nTogether with a DA server, the ERP system can use the following functions:\n\nReading values from the DA server\n\nWriting values to the DA server\n\nObtaining information about value changes in the DA server (Data Access subscription)\n\nDatabase\n\nA database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex, they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.\n\nDBMS\n\nA Database Management System is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a "database system". Often the term "database" is also used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.\n\nDCS\n\nA Distributed Control System (DCS) is a computerised control system for a process or plant usually with many control loops, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is no central operator supervisory control. This is in contrast to systems that use centralized controllers; either discrete controllers located at a central control room or within a central computer. The DCS concept increases reliability and reduces installation costs by localising control functions near the process plant, with remote monitoring and supervision.\n\nDistributed control systems first emerged in large, high value, safety critical process industries, and were attractive because the DCS manufacturer would supply both the local control level and central supervisory equipment as an integrated package, thus reducing design integration risk. Today the functionality of SCADA and DCS systems are very similar, but DCS tends to be used on large continuous process plants where high reliability and security is important, and the control room is not geographically remote.\n\nDDoS\n\nA Distributed Denial-Of-Service attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. A DDoS attack uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware. A distributed denial of service attack typically involves more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks; fewer nodes may qualify as a DoS attack but is not a DDoS attack.\n\nDeep CDR\n\nContent Disarm and Reconstruction with recursive capabilities.\n\nDeep Web\n\nThe Deep Web, Invisible Web, or Hidden Web are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search-engines. This is in contrast to the "surface web", which is accessible to anyone using the Internet. Computer-scientist Michael K. Bergman is credited with coining the term in 2001 as a search-indexing term.\n\nThe content of the Deep Web is hidden behind HTTP forms, and includes many common uses such as web mail, online banking, private or otherwise restricted access social-media pages and profiles, some web forums that require registration for viewing content, and services that users must pay for, and which are protected by paywalls, such as video on demand and some online magazines and newspapers.\n\nThe content of the deep web can be located and accessed by a direct URL or IP address, but may require a password or other security access to get past public-website pages.\n\nDHCP\n\nThe Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client–server architecture.\n\nThe technology eliminates the need for individually configuring network devices manually, and consists of two network components, a centrally installed network DHCP server and client instances of the protocol stack on each computer or device. When connected to the network, and periodically thereafter, a client requests a set of parameters from the DHCP server using the DHCP protocol.\n\nDHCP can be implemented on networks ranging in size from residential networks to large campus networks and regional ISP networks. Many routers and residential gateways have DHCP server capability. Most residential network routers receive a unique IP address within the ISP network. Within a local network, a DHCP server assigns a local IP address to each device.\n\nDHCP services exist for networks running Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), as well as version 6 (IPv6). The IPv6 version of the DHCP protocol is commonly called DHCPv6.\n\nDHS\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\nDISA\n\nDefence Information Systems Agency is a leading entity of device hardening techniques. They provide Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) documentation that outline hardening procedures.\n\nDMA\n\nDirect Memory Access. A feature of computer systems that allows for certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory RAM (Random Access Memory) independent of the CPU (Central Processing Unit).\n\nDNP3\n\nDistributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) is a set of communications protocols used between components in process automation systems. Its main use is in utilities such as electric and water companies. Usage in other industries is not common. It was developed for communications between various types of data acquisition and control equipment. It plays a crucial role in SCADA systems, where it is used by SCADA Master Stations (a.k.a. Control Centers), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). It is primarily used for communications between a master station and RTUs or IEDs. ICCP, the Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (a part of IEC 60870-6), is used for inter-master station communications. Competing standards include the older Modbus protocol and the newer IEC 61850 protocol.\n\nDNS\n\nThe Domain Name System is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.\n\nDoS\n\nA Denial-Of-Service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.\n\nDOS OS\n\nDOS is a platform-independent acronym for disk operating system which later became a common shorthand for disk-based operating systems on IBM PC compatibles. DOS primarily consists of Microsoft's MS-DOS and a rebranded version under the name IBM PC DOS, both of which were introduced in 1981. Later compatible systems from other manufacturers include DR DOS (1988), ROM-DOS (1989), PTS-DOS (1993), and FreeDOS (1998). MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995.\n\nDozens of other operating systems also use the acronym "DOS", beginning with the mainframe DOS/360 from 1966. Others include Apple DOS, Apple ProDOS, Atari DOS, Commodore DOS, TRSDOS, and AmigaDOS.\n\nDrive-By-Download\n\nMalvertisement containing code that executes automatically when users visit a compromised website.\n\nDynamic Analysis\n\nThe execution of malware in a sandbox or VM to monitor its run-time behaviors. Unlike static analysis, dynamic analysis is immune to code obfuscation.\n\nEIP\n\nEtherNet/IP protocol (EIP), which is a new standard of field bus standard. It is an open industrial networking standard that supports real-time I/O messaging, explicit message exchange.\n\nEmbedded System\n\nAn embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. In 2009 it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems.\n\nModern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the Digital Signal Processor (DSP).\n\nSince the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.\n\nEmbedded systems range from portable devices such as digital watches and MP3 players, to large stationary installations like traffic light controllers, programmable logic controllers, and large complex systems like hybrid vehicles, medical imaging systems, and avionics. Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks mounted inside a large equipment rack.\n\nEncryption\n\nThe process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users. Modern encryption schemes utilize the concepts of public-key and symmetric-key. Modern encryption techniques ensure security because modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption.\n\nEncryption is an important tool but is not sufficient alone to ensure the security or privacy of sensitive information throughout its lifetime. Most applications of encryption protect information only at rest or in transit, leaving sensitive data in clear text and potentially vulnerable to improper disclosure during processing, such as by a cloud service for example. Homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation are emerging techniques to compute on encrypted data; these techniques are general but incur high computational and/or communication costs. In response to encryption of data at rest, cyber-adversaries have developed new types of attacks. These more recent threats to encryption of data at rest include cryptographic attacks, stolen ciphertext attacks, attacks on encryption keys, insider attacks, data corruption or integrity attacks, data destruction attacks, and ransomware attacks. Data fragmentation and active defense data protection technologies attempt to counter some of these attacks by distributing, moving or mutating ciphertext so it is more difficult to identify, steal, corrupt, or destroy.\n\nERP\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) refers to a type of software that organizations use to manage day-to-day business activities such as accounting, procurement, project management, risk management and compliance, and supply chain operations. A complete ERP suite also includes enterprise performance management, software that helps plan, budget, predict, and report on an organization’s financial results.\n\nERP systems tie together a multitude of business processes and enable the flow of data between them. By collecting an organization’s shared transactional data from multiple sources, ERP systems eliminate data duplication and provide data integrity with a single source of truth.\n\nToday, ERP systems are critical for managing thousands of businesses of all sizes and in all industries. To these companies, ERP is as indispensable as the electricity that keeps the lights on.\n\nESP\n\nAn Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) is the logical border surrounding a network to which BES Cyber Systems are connected using a routable protocol.\n\nExfiltration\n\nUsed as a hacker near-synonym for data theft, unauthorized release of data from within a computer system or network.\n\nFirewall\n\nA Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules by establishing a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.\n\nFlash Memory\n\nAn electronic non-volatile computer memory storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. The two main types of flash memory, NOR flash and NAND flash, are named for the NOR and NAND logic gates. NAND flash and NOR flash use the same cell design, consisting of floating gate MOSFETs. They differ at the circuit level: in NAND flash, the relationship between the bit line and the word lines resembles a NAND gate; in NOR flash, it resembles a NOR gate; this depends on whether the state of the bit line or word lines is pulled high or low.\n\nForward Proxy Server\n\nA forward proxy is an Internet-facing proxy server used to retrieve data from a wide range of sources (in most cases anywhere on the Internet).\n\nGDPR\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU).\n\nGreen Hat Hacker\n\nHackers that are still learning the trade. They are always looking to pair up with a more knowledgeable person to learn from.\n\nGrey Hat Hacker\n\nNot quite black or white hat hackers, these individuals are as likely to hack systems with criminal or good intentions.\n\nHacktivist\n\nHackers portraying themselves as “activists” that invade government systems and websites either as individuals or in groups to steal data for political or social gain.\n\nHash Funtion\n\nA hash function is any computer algorithm that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values commonly referred to as hash values, hash codes, digests, checksums, or simply hashes.\n\nHeurisitics\n\nHeuristics algorithms detect a virus family through a generic signature or through an inexact match to an existing signature. Virus researchers find common areas that all viruses in a family share uniquely and can thus create a single generic signature. These signatures often contain non-contiguous code, using wildcard characters where differences lie. These wildcards allow the scanner to detect viruses even if they are padded with extra, meaningless code.\n\nHistorian\n\nA Historian in IT terms is an OT database. These systems include powerful throughput and data processing capabilities.\n\nHMI\n\nHuman Machine Interfaces (HMI) is a computing device with human interfaces allowing communication between humans and machines. The most common HMI include the PC, which includes a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.\n\nHTTP\n\nHyper Text Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.\n\nHTTPS\n\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.\n\nThe principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering. The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates.\n\nHypervisor\n\nA hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VM). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.\n\nI/O\n\nIn computing, Input/Output (I/O, or IO) is the communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.\n\nI/O devices are the pieces of hardware used by a human (or other system) to communicate with a computer. For instance, a keyboard or computer mouse is an input device for a computer, while monitors and printers are output devices. Devices for communication between computers, such as modems and network cards, typically perform both input and output operations.\n\nICAP\n\nThe Internet Content Adaption Protocol is a lightweight HTTP-like protocol which is used to extend transparent proxy servers, thereby freeing up resources and standardizing the way in which new features are implemented. ICAP is generally used to implement virus scanning and content filters in transparent HTTP proxy caches. Content adaptation refers to performing the value-added service (content manipulation) for the associated client request/response.\n\nICS\n\nIndustrial Control System (ICS) is a general term that encompasses several types of control systems and associated instrumentation used for industrial process control.\n\nSuch systems can range in size from a few modular panel-mounted controllers to large interconnected and interactive distributed control systems with many thousands of field connections. Systems receive data from remote sensors measuring process variables (PVs), compare the collected data with desired setpoints (SPs), and derive command functions which are used to control a process through the final control elements (FCEs), such as control valves.\n\nLarger systems are usually implemented by supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, or distributed control systems (DCS), and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), though SCADA and PLC systems are scalable down to small systems with few control loops. Such systems are extensively used in industries such as chemical processing, pulp and paper manufacture, power generation, oil and gas processing, and telecommunications.\n\nIDE\n\nShort for Integrated Drive Electronics, IDE is more commonly known as ATA or PATA (parallel ATA). It is a standard interface for IBM computers that was first developed by Western Digital and Compaq in 1986 for compatible hard drives and CD or DVD drives. IDE is different than SCSI and ESDI (Enhanced Small Disk Interface) because its controllers are on each drive, meaning the drive can connect directly to the motherboard or controller. IDE and its updated successor, EIDE (Enhanced IDE), are common drive interfaces found in IBM compatible computers. Below is a picture of the IDE connector on a hard drive, IDE cable, and the IDE channels on the motherboard.\n\nIDN Homographic Hyperlink\n\nThe Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) homograph attack is a way a malicious party may deceive computer users about what remote system they are communicating with, by exploiting the fact that many different characters look alike. For example, a regular user of example.com may be lured to click a hyperlink where the Latin character "a" is replaced with the Cyrillic character "а".\n\nThis kind of spoofing attack is also known as script spoofing. Unicode incorporates numerous writing systems, and, for a number of reasons, similar-looking characters such as Greek Ο, Latin O, and Cyrillic О were not assigned the same code. Their incorrect or malicious usage is a possibility for security attacks.\n\nThe registration of homographic domain names is akin to typosquatting, in that both forms of attacks use a similar-looking name to a more established domain to fool a user. The major difference is that in typosquatting the perpetrator attracts victims by relying on natural typographical errors commonly made when manually entering a URL, while in homograph spoofing the perpetrator deceives the victims by presenting visually indistinguishable hyperlinks. Indeed, it would be a rare accident for a web user to type, for example, a Cyrillic letter within an otherwise English word such as "citibаnk". There are cases in which a registration can be both typosquatting and homograph spoofing; the pairs of l/I, i/j, and 0/O are all both close together on keyboards and, depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish.\n\nIDP\n\nAn Identity Provider (abbreviated IdP or IDP) is a system entity that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for principals, and also provides authentication services to relying applications within a federation or distributed network.\n\nIDS/IPS\n\nAn Intrusion Detection System (IDS), or Intrustion Prevention System (IPS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.\n\nIDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. The most common classifications are Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of a HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of a NIDS.\n\nIt is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach. The most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware) and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of "good" traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Another common variant is reputation-based detection (recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation scores). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system. Intrusion detection systems can also serve specific purposes by augmenting them with custom tools, such as using a honeypot to attract and characterize malicious traffic.\n\nIEEE\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a professional association for electronic engineering. Its objectives are the educational and technical advancement of electrical and electronic engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering and similar disciplines.\n\nIETF\n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force is an open standards organization, which develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, in particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).\n\nIIoT\n\nIndustry Internet of Things\n\nIMAP\n\nInternet Message Access Protocol is an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them.\n\nIngress Filtering\n\ningress Filtering is a technique used to ensure that incoming packets are from the networks from which they claim to originate. This can be used as a countermeasure against various spoofing attacks where the attacker's packets contain fake IP addresses to make it difficult to find the source of the attack. This technique is often used in the denial-of-service attack, and this is a primary target of ingress filtering.\n\nInternet\n\nThe global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.\n\nIO Ports\n\nInput/Output port. An I/O port is a socket on a computer that a cable is plugged into. The port connects the CPU to a peripheral device via a hardware interface or to the network via a network interface.\n\nIO Server\n\nIO Servers are OT Protocol specific software used as a communication gateway between OT software applications, and any device that is being controlled or monitored.\n\nIoT\n\nThe Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects, so known as, "things" — that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that is used for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.\n\nThings have evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. The IoT can also be used in healthcare systems.\n\nThere are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of the IoT, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently the industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun including the development of international standards.\n\nIP Address\n\nInternet Protocol address. This is a numeric label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses IP for communication. These addresses standardized on IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) which defined an IP address as a 32-bit number. The growth of the internet and depletion of available IPv4 addresses necessitated a move to IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) that uses 128-bit numbers.\n\nIP Masquerading\n\nA technique that hides an entire IP address space, usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address in another, usually public address space. The hidden addresses are mapped to a single (public) IP address as the source address of the outgoing IP packets, so they appear as originating not from the hidden host but from the routing device itself.\n\nIP Spoofing\n\nIP Address Spoofing or IP Spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.\n\nISO\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations. It was one of the first organizations granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.\n\nIT\n\nInformation technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT users.\n\nJSON\n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪˌsɒn/) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with a diverse range of functionality in data interchange including communication of web applications with servers.\n\nJSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. JSON filenames use the extension .json.\n\nKeylogger\n\nA specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes—great for stealing passwords.\n\nLAN\n\nA Local Area Network is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.\n\nLoad Balancing\n\nLoad Balancing refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.\n\nMAC Address\n\nA Media Access Control Address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. As typically represented, MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator. MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers and are therefore often referred to as the burned-in address, or as an Ethernet hardware address, hardware address, or physical address. Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's Read-Only Memory (ROM), or by a firmware mechanism. Network nodes with multiple network interfaces, such as routers and multilayer switches, must have a unique MAC address for each NIC in the same network. However, two NICs connected to two different networks can share the same MAC address.\n\nMalvertisement\n\nThe use of legitimate ads or ad networks to covertly deliver malware to unsuspecting users’ computers. For example, a cybercriminal will place an ad on a legitimate website containing code that redirects users to a malicious website or which installs malware on their computer when clicked.\n\nMalware\n\nMalware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information.\n\nMES\n\nManufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are computerized systems used in manufacturing to track and document the transformation of raw materials to finished goods. MES provides information that helps manufacturing decision makers understand how current conditions on the plant floor can be optimized to improve production output. MES works in real time to enable the control of multiple elements of the production process (e.g. inputs, personnel, machines and support services).\n\nMES may operate across multiple function areas, for example: management of product definitions across the product life-cycle, resource scheduling, order execution and dispatch, production analysis and downtime management for overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), product quality, or materials track and trace. MES creates the "as-built" record, capturing the data, processes and outcomes of the manufacturing process. This can be especially important in regulated industries, such as food and beverage or pharmaceutical, where documentation and proof of processes, events and actions may be required.\n\nThe idea of MES might be seen as an intermediate step between, on the one hand, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or process control system on the other; although historically, exact boundaries have fluctuated. Industry groups such as MESA International—Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association were created in the early 1990s in order to address the complexity, and advise on execution, of MES Systems.\n\nMODBUS\n\nModbus is a data communications protocol originally published by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Modbus has become a de facto standard communication protocol and is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices.\n\nModbus is popular in industrial environments because it is openly published and royalty-free. It was developed for industrial applications, is relatively easy to deploy and maintain compared to other standards, and places few restrictions - other than the datagram (packet) size - on the format of the data to be transmitted.\n\nThe Modbus protocol uses character serial communication lines, Ethernet, or the Internet protocol suite as a transport layer.\n\nModbus supports communication to and from multiple devices connected to the same cable or Ethernet network. For example, there can be a device that measures temperature and another device to measure humidity connected to the same cable, both communicating measurements to the same computer.\n\nModbus is often used to connect a plant/system supervisory computer with a remote terminal unit (RTU) in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in the electric power industry. Many of the data types are named from industrial control of factory devices, such as Ladder logic because of its use in driving relays: A single physical output is called a coil, and a single physical input is called a discrete input or a contact.\n\nThe development and update of Modbus protocols have been managed by the Modbus Organization since April 2004, when Schneider Electric transferred rights to that organization. The Modbus Organization is an association of users and suppliers of Modbus-compliant devices that advocates for the continued use of the technology. Modbus Organization, Inc. is a trade association for the promotion and development of Modbus protocol.\n\nMQTT\n\nMQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. The protocol usually runs over TCP/IP; however, any network protocol that provides ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections can support MQTT. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The protocol is an open OASIS standard and an ISO recommendation (ISO/IEC 20922).\n\nMX Record\n\nA mail exchanger record (MX record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is a resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS). It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of mail servers for load balancing and redundancy.\n\nNAC\n\nNetwork Access Control is a computer networking solution that uses a set of protocols to define and implement a policy that describes how to secure access to network nodes by devices when they initially attempt to access a network.\n\nNAS(1)\n\nNetwork Attached Storage is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients. NAS systems are networked appliances that contain one or more storage drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID.\n\nNAS(2)\n\nA Network Attached Server concentrates dial-in and dial-out user communications. An access server may have a mixture of analog and digital interfaces and support hundreds of simultaneous users. A NAS consists of a communications processor that connects asynchronous devices to a LAN or WAN through network and terminal emulation software. It performs both synchronous and asynchronous routing of supported protocols. The NAS is meant to act as a gateway to guard access to a protected resource. This can be anything from a telephone network, to printers, to the Internet. A client connects to the NAS. The NAS then connects to another resource asking whether the client's supplied credentials are valid. Based on that answer the NAS then allows or disallows access to the protected resource.\n\nNAT\n\nNetwork Address Translation is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.\n\nNeed-To-Know\n\nThe term "need to know", when used by government and other organizations (particularly those related to the military or espionage), describes the restriction of data which is considered very sensitive. Under need-to-know restrictions, even if one has all the necessary official approvals (such as a security clearance) to access certain information, one would not be given access to such information, or read into a clandestine operation, unless one has a specific need to know; that is, access to the information must be necessary for one to conduct one's official duties. This term also includes anyone that the people with the knowledge deemed necessary to share it with.\n\nNERC\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is a not-for-profit international regulatory authority whose mission is to assure the effective and efficient reduction of risks to the reliability and security of the grid. NERC develops and enforces Reliability Standards; annually assesses seasonal and long‐term reliability; monitors the bulk power system through system awareness; and educates, trains, and certifies industry personnel. NERC’s area of responsibility spans the continental United States, Canada, and the northern portion of Baja California, Mexico. NERC is the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) for North America, subject to oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and governmental authorities in Canada. NERC's jurisdiction includes users, owners, and operators of the bulk power system, which serves nearly 400 million people.\n\nNetFlow\n\nNetFlow is a feature that was introduced on Cisco routers around 1996 that provides the ability to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an interface. By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a network administrator can determine things such as the source and destination of traffic, class of service, and the causes of congestion. A typical flow monitoring setup (using NetFlow) consists of three main components:\n\nFlow exporter: aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records towards one or more flow collectors.\n\nFlow collector: responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow data received from a flow exporter.\n\nAnalysis application: analyzes received flow data in the context of intrusion detection or traffic profiling, for example.\n\nNetwork Address\n\nAn identifier for a node or host on a telecommunications network. Network addresses are designed to be unique identifiers across the network, although some networks allow for local, private addresses, or locally administered addresses that may not be unique. Special network addresses are allocated as broadcast or multicast addresses. These too are not unique. In some cases, network hosts may have more than one network address. For example, each network interface may be uniquely identified. Further, because protocols are frequently layered, more than one protocol's network address can occur in any network interface or node and more than one type of network address may be used in any one network. Network addresses can be flat addresses which contain no information about the node's location in the network (such as a MAC address) or may contain structure or hierarchical information for the routing (such as an IP address).\n\nNetwork Protocol Stack\n\nAn implementation of a computer networking protocol suite or protocol family. Individual protocols within a suite are often designed with a single purpose in mind. This modularization simplifies design and evaluation. Because each protocol module usually communicates with two others, they are commonly imagined as layers in a stack of protocols. The lowest protocol always deals with low-level interaction with the communications hardware. Each higher layer adds additional capabilities. User applications usually deal only with the topmost layers.\n\nNetwork Routing\n\nA router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g., the Internet) until it reaches its destination node. A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks. When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the network address information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.\n\nNIC\n\nNetwork Interface Controller, also known as a network interface card, network adapter, LAN adapter or physical network interface, and by similar terms) is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network.\n\nNon-Voluntile Memory\n\nNon-volatile memory (NVM) or non-volatile storage is a type of computer memory that can retain stored information even after power is removed.\n\nOAuth\n\nOAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. Generally, OAuth provides clients a "secure delegated access" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without providing credentials. Designed specifically to work with HTTP, OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.\n\nOKta\n\nOkta, Inc. is a publicly traded identity and access management company based in San Francisco. It provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into applications, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, website web services, and devices.\n\nOPC\n\nOpen Platform Communications (OPC) is a series of standards and specifications for industrial telecommunication. An industrial automation task force developed the original standard in 1996 under the name OLE for Process Control (Object Linking and Embedding for process control). OPC specifies the communication of real-time plant data between control devices from different manufacturers.\n\nAfter the initial release in 1996, the OPC Foundation was created to maintain the standard. As OPC has been adopted beyond the field of process control, the OPC Foundation changed the name to Open Platform Communications in 2011. The change in name reflects the applications of OPC technology for applications in building automation, discrete manufacturing, process control and many others. OPC has also grown beyond its original OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) implementation to include other data transportation technologies including Microsoft's .NET Framework, XML, and even the OPC Foundation's binary-encoded TCP format.\n\nOpen Proxy Server\n\nA forwarding proxy server accessible to any internet user consisting of two types.\n\n1. Anonymous. Reveals its identity as a proxy server but does not disclose the originating IP address of the client.\n\n2. Transparent. The originating IP address of the client can be retrieved.\n\nOS\n\nAn Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources. Commonly used OS include Windows, MAC OS, and Linux.\n\nOSI Model\n\nThe Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual framework that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols. The model partitions the flow of data in a communication system into seven abstraction layers, from the physical implementation of transmitting bits across a communications medium to the highest-level representation of data of a distributed application. Each intermediate layer serves a class of functionality to the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. Classes of functionality are realized in software by standardized communication protocols.\n\nOT\n\nOperational Technology (OT) is hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of industrial equipment, assets, processes and events. The term has become established to demonstrate the technological and functional differences between traditional IT systems and Industrial Control Systems environments. Examples of operational technology include:\n\nProgrammable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA), Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems, including computerized machine tools, scientific equipment (e.g. digital oscilloscopes), Building Management and Building Automation Systems, (BMS)/(BAS), lighting controls both for internal and external applications, energy monitoring, security and safety systems for the built environment, and transportation systems for the built environment.\n\nOT Protocols\n\nOT Protocols are OT Communication languages unique to OT Software and Devices.\n\nPCA\n\nA Protected Cyber Asset, or PCA is a cyber asset connected using a routable protocol within or on an Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) that is not part of the most critical BES Cyber System within the same ESP.\n\nPCS\n\nProcess Control Systems (PCS) include Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS). Refer to the definitions of each in this Glossary.\n\nPhishing\n\nPhishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent ("spoofed") message designed to trick a human victim into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware.\n\nPLC\n\nA Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) or programmable controller is an industrial computer that has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, machines, robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis.\n\nPLCs can range from small modular devices with tens of inputs and outputs (I/O), in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and SCADA systems.\n\nThey can be designed for many arrangements of digital and analog I/O, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory.\n\nPOP3\n\nPost Office Protocol version 3 is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a mail server.\n\nPort Forwarding\n\nIn computer networking, port forwarding, or port mapping is an application of network address translation (NAT) that redirects a communication request from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router or firewall. This technique is commonly used to make services on a host residing on a protected or masqueraded (internal) network available to hosts on the opposite side of the gateway (external network), by remapping the destination IP address and port number of the communication to an internal host.\n\nPosture Check\n\nA system check to detect endpoint antimalware, antiphishing, backup, cloud storage, communication tools, data loss prevention, endpoint encryption, health agent, hypervisor, personal firewall, VPN client, Web browser, and Web Collaboration applications as well as for potentially unwanted applications.\n\nProxy Server\n\nA server application or appliance that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from providers. A proxy server thus functions on behalf of the client when requesting services,\n\nPUA\n\nPotentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs) are unwanted software programs that come bundled in legitimate free software programs as a package. These may also be called Potentially Unwanted Programs, or PUPs.\n\nNot all PUAs are destructive, but some can cause very annoying behaviors, like generating pop up ads or causing your computer to run very slowly. These applications can negatively affect a computer’s performance and can even introduce security risks such as spyware and other unwanted programs.\n\nPurdue Model\n\nPurdue Enterprise Reference Architecture, or PERA, is a 1990s reference model for enterprise architecture that can model the enterprise in multiple layers and in multiple stages of the architectural life cycle. It consists of five levels:\n\n0. Physical Process - Defines the actual physical processes.\n\n1. Intelligent Devices - Sensing and manipulating the physical processes. Process *sensors, analyzers, actuators and related instrumentation.\n\n2. Control Systems - Supervising, monitoring and controlling the physical processes. Real-time controls and software; DCS, human-machine interface (HMI); supervisory and data acquisition (SCADA) software.\n\n3. Manufacturing Operations Systems - Managing production workflow to produce the desired products. Batch management; manufacturing execution/operations management systems (MES/MOMS); laboratory, maintenance and plant performance management systems; data historians and related middleware.

ERP is the primary system; establishes the basic plant production schedule, material use, shipping and inventory levels. Time frame: months, weeks, days, shifts.\n\nRADIUS\n\nRemote Authentication Dial-In User Service is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service. RADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer and can use either TCP or UDP.\n\nRAM\n\nRandom-Access Memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.\n\nRansomware\n\na type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.\n\nRed Hat Hacker\n\nLike White Hat Hackers, these experts attempt to stop Black Hat Hackers from doing harm. While their intentions are “good”, they often leave a trail of wrecked systems behind in their ruthless pursuit of those they deem bad.\n\nRest API\n\nRepresentational State Transfer Application Programming Interface is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful. The goal of REST is to increase performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.\n\nReverse Proxy Server\n\nIn computer networks such as the internet, a reverse proxy is a proxy server that is accessible from the public network which can include features such as compression, TLS encryption, and HTTP header inspection. They are typically managed by the web service and accessed by clients from the public internet.\n\nRM\n\nRemovable Media. Any media storage device that can be carried and connected to a given network.\n\nROM\n\nRead-Only Memory is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can't be electronically modified after the manufacture of the memory device.\n\nRootkit\n\nA collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software.\n\nRTP\n\nReal Time Protection involves active AV scans and automatic definition updates that run as background processes.\n\nSAML\n\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML), which is an open standard that allows identity providers to pass authorization credentials to service providers and has been a revolutionary technology for securing users and their accounts, by preventing passwords from being stored on multiple servers where each one has the potential to be hacked and breached.\n\nSATA\n\nSerial ATA (SATA), is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives.\n\nSCADA\n\nSupervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a control system architecture comprised of computers, networked data communications and Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for high-level process supervisory management, while also comprising other peripheral devices like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and discrete Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers to interface with process plant or machinery. The use of SCADA has been considered also for management and operations of project-driven-processes in construction.\n\nScript\n\nA sequence of instructions or commands for a computer to execute. Especially : one that automates a small task (such as assembling or sorting a set of data).\n\nScript Kiddies\n\nAmateur hackers that use scripts written by other hackers because they don’t know how to hack by themselves. They use these scripts to attempt to gain access to systems, networks, or websites. Their goal is to get the attention of their peers.\n\nSDP\n\nSoftware Defined Perimeter, also called a "Black Cloud", is an effort to control access to resources based on identity. Connectivity in a Software Defined Perimeter is based on a need-to-know model, in which device posture and identity are verified before access to application infrastructure is granted.\n\nSecurity Hacker\n\nA Security Hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network.\n\nServer\n\nA piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.[1] Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.\n\nsFlow\n\nsFlow, short for "sampled flow", is an industry standard for packet export at Layer 2 of the OSI model. It provides a means for exporting truncated packets, together with interface counters for the purpose of network monitoring. Maintenance of the protocol is performed by the sFlow.org consortium, the authoritative source of the sFlow protocol specifications. The current version of sFlow is v5.\n\nSIEM\n\nSecurity Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a field within the field of computer security, where software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. Vendors sell SIEM as software, as appliances, or as managed services; these products are also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance purposes. The term and the initialism SIEM was coined by Mark Nicolett and Amrit Williams of Gartner in 2005.\n\nSMTP\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol is an internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages. User-level email clients typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying.\n\nSOCKS\n\nAn Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server. SOCKS5 (SOCKS version 5) optionally provides authentication so only authorized users may access a server. Practically, a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded. SOCKS performs at Layer 5 of the OSI model (the session layer, an intermediate layer between the presentation layer and the transport layer). A SOCKS server accepts incoming client connection on TCP port 1080, as defined in RFC 1928.\n\nSpyware\n\nMalware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party.\n\nSSID\n\nIn IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networking standards (including Wi-Fi), a service set is a group of wireless network devices which share a Service Set Identifier (SSID)—typically the natural language label that users see as a network name. (For example, all of the devices that together form and use a Wi‑Fi network called Foo are a service set.) A service set forms a logical network of nodes operating with shared link-layer networking parameters; they form one logical network segment.\n\nSSO\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to login with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.\n\nTrue SSO allows the user to login once and access services without re-entering authentication factors.\n\nState Sponsored Hacker\n\nHackers working for or on behalf of a Nation State which are unleashed upon an unsuspecting country’s systems, networks, and websites with the goal of gaining confidential data which could be useful for their employer’s self-defense.\n\nStatic Analysis\n\nStatic malware analysis involves examining any given malware sample without actually running or executing the code. This is usually done by determining the signature of the malware binary; the signature is a unique identification for the binary file.\n\nTAGNAME\n\nA TAGNAME is the unique item definition used to read or write something in an industrial control system device.\n\nTCA\n\nTransient Cyber Asset. A cyber asset that is capable of transmitting or transferring executable code, is not included in a BES Cyber System, is not a Protected Cyber Asset (PCA), and is directly connected (e.g., using Ethernet, serial, USB, or wireless, including near field or Bluetooth communication) for 30 consecutive calendar days or less to a BES Cyber Asset. Examples include, but are not limited to, cyber assets used for data transfer, vulnerability assessment, maintenance, or troubleshooting purposes.\n\nTCP/IP\n\nThe Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, these are:\n\n1. Link Layer. This layer contains communication methods for data that remain within a single network segment (link).\n\n2. Internet Layer. Provides internetworking between independent networks.\n\n3. Transport Layer. Handles host-to-host communication\n\n4. Application Layer. Provides process-to-process data exchange for applications.\n\nThe technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.\n\nTLS\n\nTransport Layer Security is the successor of the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications. The TLS protocol comprises two layers: the TLS record and the TLS handshake protocols.\n\nTOR\n\nTOR, short for The Onion Router, is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. It directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network, consisting of more than six thousand relays for concealing a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using TOR makes it more difficult to trace the Internet activity to the user. TORs intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored.\n\nTOR Browser\n\nThe Tor Browser is the flagship product of the Tor Project. It was created as the Tor Browser Bundle by Steven J. Murdoch and announced in January 2008. The Tor Browser consists of a modified Mozilla Firefox ESR web browser, the TorButton, TorLauncher, NoScript, and HTTPS Everywhere Firefox extensions and the Tor proxy. Users can run the Tor Browser from removable media. It can operate under Microsoft Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n\nThe Tor Browser automatically starts TOR background processes and routes traffic through the TOR network. Upon termination of a session the browser deletes privacy-sensitive data such as HTTP cookies and the browsing history.\n\nTo allow download from places where accessing the Tor Project URL may be risky or blocked, a GitHub repository is maintained with links for releases hosted in other domains.\n\nTrojan\n\nA program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.\n\nTyposquatting\n\nTyposquatting, also called URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL, is a form of cybersquatting, and possibly brandjacking which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser. Should a user accidentally enter an incorrect website address, they may be led to any URL (including an alternative website owned by a cybersquatter).\n\nThe typosquatter's URL will usually be one of five kinds, all similar to the victim site address:\n\n-A common misspelling, or foreign language spelling, of the intended site\n\n-A misspelling based on a typographical error\n\n-A plural of a singular domain name\n\n-A different top-level domain: (i.e. .com instead of .org)\n\n-An abuse of the Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) (.cm, .co, or .om instead of .com)\n\nSimilar abuses:\n\nCombosquatting - no misspelling, but appending an arbitrary word that appears legitimate, but that anyone could register.\n\nDoppelganger domain - omitting a period or inserting an extra period\n\nAppending terms such as sucks or -suckes to a domain name\n\nOnce in the typosquatter's site, the user may also be tricked into thinking that they are in fact in the real site, through the use of copied or similar logos, website layouts, or content. Spam emails sometimes make use of typosquatting URLs to trick users into visiting malicious sites that look like a given bank's site, for instance.\n\nUDG\n\nUnidirectional gateways are a combination of hardware and software. The hardware permits data to flow from one network to another, but is physically unable to send any information at all back into the source network. The software replicates databases and emulates protocol servers and devices.\n\nUDP\n\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication channels or data paths. UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. UDP provides checksums for data integrity and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.\n\nUSB\n\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard that establishes specifications for cables and connectors and protocols for connection, communication and power supply (interfacing) between computers, peripherals and other computers. A broad variety of USB hardware exists, including eleven different connectors, of which USB-C is the most recent.\n\nVirus\n\nA piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.\n\nVLAN\n\nA Virtual Local Area Network is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). VLANs work by applying tags to network frames and handling these tags in networking systems – creating the appearance and functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network but acts as if it is split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed. VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts together even if the hosts are not directly connected to the same network switch. Because VLAN membership can be configured through software, this can greatly simplify network design and deployment. LAN: Local Area Network.\n\nVM\n\nA Virtual Machine is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system including the operating system and functioning hardware (RAM and hard drive assets) assigned by the host computer. Virtual machines differ and are organized by their function. These include:\n\n* System Virtual Machines (also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, virtualization-specific hardware, primarily from the host CPUs.\n\n* Process Virtual Machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.\n\nVolatile Memory\n\nVolatile memory is computer storage that only maintains its data while the device is powered.\n\nVPN\n\nA Virtual Private Network extends a private network to a public domain and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as though their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. It provides access to resources that may be inaccessible on the public network.\n\nVulnerability\n\nA flaw or weakness in a computer system, its security procedures, internal controls, or design and implementation, which could be exploited to violate the system security policy.\n\nW3C\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.\n\nWAN\n\nA wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area for the primary purpose of computer networking. WANs are used to connect LANs and other types of networks together so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations.\n\nWebhook\n\nA webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks. These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application.\n\nWhistelblower\n\nIndividuals working within an organization that expose confidential information or illegal activities.\n\nWhite Hat Hacker\n\n“Ethical” hackers that are authorized or certified to hack systems to find vulnerabilities before bad actors discover them.\n\nWorm\n\nA standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.\n\nWWW\n\nWorld Wide Web. Commonly known as The Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URL), such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of The Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a web browser such as Google Chrome, and are published by a software application called a web server.\n\nZero Day\n\nUnregistered vulnerabilities in an application or system that can be used for malicious intent.`
