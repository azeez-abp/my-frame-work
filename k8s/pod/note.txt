A Kubernetes pod is the smallest unit of deployment. Itâ€™s a cluster of one or more 
containers that share the same storage space, and even the same network resources

Each Kubernetes pod has a unique IP address, constant storage volumes and 
specific configuration information for running the containers. A pod that 
consists of more than one container makes it easier to share data and communicate 
seamlessly between them. Moreover, the same network resource enables the containers 
to locate each other through localhost.
