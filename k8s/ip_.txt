To configure a static IP address on Ubuntu, you'll need to modify the network configuration file. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Identify the network interface name you want to configure. You can list available interfaces using the following command:

```bash
ifconfig -a
```

The interface name is usually something like `eth0` or `ens33`.

3. Open the network configuration file in a text editor. You can use a command-line text editor like Nano:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
```

4. Inside the file, you will see something like this:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: yes
```

Change it to:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.0.100/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.0.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
```
      addresses: [10.0.2.15/24]
      gateway4: 10.0.2.2
Note : first 3 digit if ip ang gateway are alway equall, if the gateway is wrong no network
Replace `ens33` with your actual network interface name. Set the `addresses` to your desired static IP address along with the subnet mask. Set `gateway4` to your router's IP address and specify DNS servers in the `nameservers` section.

5. Save the file and close the editor (in Nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and then `Enter`).

6. Apply the changes:
sudo netplan try    test it first
sudo netplan apply

using command\

Certainly! If you prefer using the `ip` command to add a static IP address, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Identify the network interface name you want to configure. You can list available interfaces using the following command:

```bash
ip link show
```

The interface name is usually something like `eth0` or `ens33`.

3. Add the static IP address using the `ip` command. For example, if your interface is `ens33` and you want to assign the IP `192.168.0.100/24`, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.100/24 dev ens33
```

Replace `ens33` with your actual network interface name and adjust the IP address and subnet mask as needed.

4. Set up the default gateway (if required). Use the following command to add a default gateway:

```bash
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.0.1
```

Replace `192.168.0.1` with your router's IP address.

5. Configure DNS servers (if required). Edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to include the DNS servers you want to use:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

Add the DNS servers like this:

```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

Replace the IP addresses with the DNS servers of your choice.

6. Verify the changes by running:

```bash
ip addr show ens33
```

This should display the new static IP address.

7. Restart the network service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```

Remember that these changes will persist until the next system reboot. If you want them to be permanent, consider updating your network configuration files (e.g., `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` as mentioned earlier).

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

7. Verify the changes by running:

```bash
ip addr show ens33
```

This should display the new static IP address.

8. Restart the network service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```

That's it! Your Ubuntu system should now be configured with a static IP address. Remember to adjust the values to match your network configuration.
