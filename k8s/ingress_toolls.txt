Apart from Nginx, there are several other popular tools and controllers that can be used for Ingress in Kubernetes:

1. **Traefik**: Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that is designed for microservices. It integrates with various orchestrators, including Kubernetes, and supports features like automatic SSL, ACME, and Let's Encrypt.

2. **HAProxy**: HAProxy is a high-performance TCP/HTTP load balancer that can be used as an Ingress controller in Kubernetes. It is known for its reliability, high availability, and scalability.

3. **Contour**: Contour is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes that works by deploying the Envoy proxy as a reverse proxy and load balancer. It provides advanced features like HTTP/2, WebSockets, and gRPC.

4. **Ambassador**: Ambassador is an open-source API gateway designed for microservices. It can be used as an Ingress controller for Kubernetes and provides features like rate limiting, authentication, and more.

5. **Istio**: Istio is a service mesh that includes an Ingress gateway component. While it provides much more than just Ingress functionality, it can be used as a powerful Ingress controller with advanced features like traffic management, security, and observability.

6. **Kong**: Kong is an open-source API gateway and microservices management layer that can be used as an Ingress controller. It provides features like authentication, rate limiting, and transformations.

7. **AWS ALB Ingress Controller**: If you're using AWS, you can use the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) Ingress controller. It provisions and configures an ALB to route traffic to your services.

8. **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) Ingress**: If you're using Google Cloud Platform, GKE provides a native Ingress controller that works seamlessly with Google Cloud Load Balancers.

9. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Ingress**: If you're using Azure, AKS provides an Ingress controller that can be used to route traffic from the internet to services in your AKS cluster.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other Ingress controllers and API gateways available. The choice of which one to use depends on your specific requirements, preferences, and existing infrastructure. It's recommended to evaluate each controller based on your needs and compatibility with your environment.
