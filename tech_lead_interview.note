Measuring team performance can be done in various ways such as tracking project completion rates, monitoring code quality and identifying any bugs, conducting regular team evaluations and feedback sessions, assessing team members' skills and productivity, and looking at how effectively the team communicates and collaborates.

To help team members create goals, I would encourage open communication and collaboration to identify areas where individual team members could improve or where the team as a whole could benefit from setting goals. I would work with each team member to define specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that align with the project objectives and their personal career development goals.

To find qualified team members, I would first define the specific skills and experience needed for the role and then utilize various recruitment resources such as job postings, networking, and referrals from existing team members. I would then conduct thorough interviews, technical assessments, and reference checks to identify candidates who possess the necessary skills, experience, and cultural fit.

If there was a disagreement between team members, I would encourage open and respectful communication to understand each team member's perspective and work towards a mutually agreeable solution. If necessary, I would mediate and provide guidance to help the team members find a resolution.

To motivate the team to meet deadlines, I would ensure that they have a clear understanding of the project timeline and milestones, set achievable goals and provide regular feedback on their progress. I would also encourage a positive and supportive team culture and celebrate achievements and successes along the way.

In a situation where things did not go as planned, I would take a step back and assess the situation to identify the root cause of the problem. I would then work with the team to create a plan to address the issue, focusing on any lessons learned and making any necessary adjustments to the project plan.

Properly onboarding a new team member involves providing them with an overview of the company, its culture, and policies. I would then provide an introduction to the team and their roles and responsibilities, provide training on the project and tools they will be using, and assign them a mentor or buddy to help them integrate into the team.

If I found a developer who would be more efficient on another team, I would discuss the situation with the other team leader and the team member in question to ensure a smooth transfer. I would also ensure that the team member is given the appropriate support and resources to integrate into their new team.

If a team member suggested using new hardware or software, I would encourage them to research and present the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed solution. I would then work with the team to assess the feasibility of the proposal and consider any budget or resource constraints before making a decision.

When designing a new software system, my research process would involve identifying the project objectives and requirements, researching existing solutions and best practices, conducting feasibility studies and cost-benefit analyses, and collaborating with stakeholders to define a comprehensive project plan.

The first thing I would do as the technical lead at your company is to familiarize myself with the company's culture, values, and technical infrastructure. I would then assess the current state of the projects and team members and work to understand the company's long-term goals and objectives.

In the first 90 days of my appointment, I would focus on building relationships with the team members and stakeholders, getting up to speed on current projects and identifying any areas for improvement, setting performance expectations and goals for the team, and developing a plan to achieve the company's long-term objectives. I would also prioritize ongoing professional development for myself and the team to ensure we are keeping up with the latest trends and technologies in our field.
