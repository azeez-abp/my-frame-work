Sure! `scp` (secure copy) is a command-line utility for securely copying files and directories between local and remote hosts. It uses the SSH protocol to encrypt data during transmission, making it a secure way to transfer files.

Here's how you can use `scp`:

### Copying a File from Local to Remote:

```bash
scp /path/to/local/file username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory/
```

- Replace `/path/to/local/file` with the path to the file you want to copy.
- Replace `username` with your remote username.
- Replace `remote_host` with the address or hostname of the remote machine.
- Replace `/path/to/remote/directory/` with the path to the remote directory where you want to copy the file.

### Copying a File from Remote to Local:

```bash
scp username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory/
```

- Replace `username` with your remote username.
- Replace `remote_host` with the address or hostname of the remote machine.
- Replace `/path/to/remote/file` with the path to the file on the remote machine.
- Replace `/path/to/local/directory/` with the path to the local directory where you want to copy the file.

### Copying a Directory Recursively:

To copy a directory and its contents recursively, you'll need to use the `-r` option:

```bash
scp -r /path/to/local/directory username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/
```

- Replace `/path/to/local/directory` with the path to the local directory you want to copy.
- Replace `username` with your remote username.
- Replace `remote_host` with the address or hostname of the remote machine.
- Replace `/path/to/remote/` with the path to the remote directory where you want to copy the contents.

### Using Non-Standard SSH Port:

If the remote SSH server is using a non-standard port (not 22), you can specify it using the `-P` option:

```bash
scp -P port_number /path/to/local/file username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory/
```

- Replace `port_number` with the actual port number.

### Example:

Copying a file from local to remote:

```bash
scp my_file.txt user@remote.example.com:/home/user/documents/
```

Copying a file from remote to local:

```bash
scp user@remote.example.com:/home/user/documents/my_file.txt /path/to/local/directory/
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `username`, `remote_host`, and file paths with your actual information.

Make sure that you have the necessary permissions and access rights to perform these operations on both the local and remote systems.
