Step 1
Ask any adult you know if they will grant you a short interview (30 minutes or less) and schedule a time to do this, either in person, or by phone video chat, as soon as possible.

I Ask Mrs Amaka Uche Shedule meeting and she told me to come back two hours later on 27/06/2023

Step 2
When it is time for the interview, If at all possible, record audio of the interview (with your interviewee’s permission, of course). Otherwise, take notes by hand and immediately after the interview type what you can remember.
 She did not allow record so I write.

Step 3
Speak each question aloud to your interviewee. Feel free to slightly modify the language to make it sound like you, but please make sure you ask all of these questions.

1. Thank you for sharing your time with me today. This should take 30 minutes or less of your time. I’m learning more about success and failure and am hoping you’d be willing to share honestly with me about your own experiences with each. I will not be sharing your full name nor specific story with others, and it would help me if you could be as honest as possible.
 
Mrs Blessing: Welcome I will be glad to answer tour question and share more of my experiences about success and failure

2. Can you share a brief story about a time you were successful in your life? Usually the first story that pops to mind is the best one. How did you feel when you succeeded? What do you think helped you achieve this success?
 Mrs blessing: Well, Success is targeted towards a specific goal. One Success that I recently archived is my marriage. There are lot of challenges  like relogion and ethnicity, but because of my detarmination and perseverance, I got married to the my of my dream and I never regret one day that I got married to despite that fact that none of his family is at the wedding ceremony.



3. Thank you. Can you describe a time in your life where you failed at something that was important to you? Usually the first story that pops to mind is the best one. How did you feel when you failed? What do you think contributed to this failure?

Mrs Blessing: Well it si not everything you attempt in life that will come down to your feet. this is where I learnt that it takes more that determination and effort to be successful. infact the first factor of success is sound mind and health. Tell me, how can a metally derailed man become software engineer(is that not what you are aiming at?. Me: yes).
I failed to become a fashion designer because of my spine. I cannot say more please. 
Me: that's ok ma.

4. What did you learn from your success? 
   Mrs Blessing: What I learnt is that success depend of factors like
   1. Good heath and sound mind
   2. You have to apply effort
   3. You Have to keep going untill you achieve it (Persever)

5. What did you learn from your failure? (Ask for elaboration if needed).
  Mrs Blessing: Before  attempting anything check your health if you will be able to cope

6. Thank you again for sharing your stories with me. Is there anything you would like me to know?
  Mrs Blessing: yes, as you are aiming to be successful in your endeavors, don't forget your health.
7. This concludes our interview. Thank you again for your time and sharing. I appreciate it very much.

  Items of documentation
   key: we write code for another programmer to read
   architectural documentation
   Comments 
   Names of functions and variables
   Indentation
   Git commit messages 
   Always put a README.md

   Symptoms and risks of over-documenting
   Don’t document the tools you use. Rule of thumb: if some information that is in the documentation is findable online, it doesn’t belong in your documentation.
   Getting into the project is hard, because it takes more than 10 minutes to read the documentation to get started.
   It takes more than 30 seconds / 1 minute to search for the right specific information about anything, even when knowing where to look.
   Making a change is complex, because you have to ensure that the various places where things are documented are up to date. Resulting risks could be:
   
   people avoid making changes so that they don’t have to worry about finding what to update in the documentation (the thing that Apple feared);
   
   because it’s too complex, people don’t bother updating the documentation, or fail to change something relevant in the documentation, which gradually turns outdated

Developing professional relationships requires…


respect   => Relation


industry experience => networking


energy  => relation


professional leverage => Networking


time  => relation


empathy  => relation


Networking is all about relationships.
it is about mutually respecting others that share your interest.
Don’t think of networking simply as the means to a job; it’s about investing into an industry community in such a way that makes it an industry you want to stay in.
As you network, be mindful of the traits you’re contributing to the tech industry.
Collaborative. Teachable. Helpful. Giving. vs Egocentric. Withholding. Overbearing.

Networking is about….
investing into a community
mutual respect
relationships
give and take

Arrays Vs Linked Lists: select all true statements
Linked list can contain as value a structure
We can easily removed an element from a Linked list
We can add elements indefinitely to a linked list
