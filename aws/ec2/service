Amazon Inspector adds enhanced vulnerability intelligence to its findings
Amazon Inspector now provides enhanced vulnerability intelligence as a part of its findings. The enhanced vulnerability intelligence includes names of known malware kits used to exploit a vulnerability, mapping to MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework, the date Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the vulnerability to Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog (KVEC), Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) score, and evidence of public events associated with a vulnerability

When you activate Inspector, you grant Inspector permissions to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS on your behalf and to generate findings about potential security issues. This will activate Inspector for your account only.

Role name: AWSServiceRoleForAmazonInspector2
The following policy document contains the permissions that Inspector requires to detect and protect resources in your AWS environment.

Amazon Inspector Classic pricing is based on the number of EC2 instances included in each assessment and the rules packages used in those assessments.

To get started, activate Amazon EC2, Amazon ECR, AWS Lambda scanning for your member accounts.

Why use Session Manager?
Improved security posture
Avoid the need to set up or maintain bastion hosts, to open up inbound SSH or remote PowerShell ports, or to provision or manage SSH keys and certificates.

Centralized access control
Grant and revoke access control to instances from one location using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

Detailed audit records
Quickly view audit trails of user access to machines. Review session logs to debug or troubleshoot the actions performed on an instance during a session.

Cross-platform and VPC support
Enjoy one-click access to Windows and Linux instances, and integration with AWS PrivateLink for access instances without public IP addresses.

By default, AWS Systems Manager doesn't have permission to perform actions on your instances. You can provide instance permissions at the account level using an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
