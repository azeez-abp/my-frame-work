The components of the Flyweight Design Pattern are:

1. Flyweight: This is an interface that defines the methods that must be implemented by concrete flyweight objects.

2. Concrete Flyweight: This implements the Flyweight interface and defines the properties that are intrinsic to the
    objects,  such as their state.

3. Flyweight Factory: This is responsible for creating and managing the flyweight objects. It ensures that
    the objects are shared among multiple clients.


4. Client: This is the object that makes use of the Flyweight objects. It provides the context that is extrinsic to
the objects and passes it to the Flyweight objects for use in their operations.





Flyweight design pattern can be implemented in the following steps:

Identify the intrinsic and extrinsic state variables. Intrinsic state variables are common and shared among objects, while extrinsic state variables are unique and specific to each object.

Create a factory class that acts as a cache for the objects, maintaining a pool of objects in memory.

Create a Flyweight class that holds the intrinsic state variables and a factory method that returns the object from the cache, or creates a new object if it does not exist.

In the client code, use the factory method to get the Flyweight object and set the extrinsic state variables as required.

When the client no longer requires the Flyweight object, return it to the cache for reuse.

Example code in Python:

1. class that has properties to inherit
2. class that inherit those properties

1  A class
2. A class that use existing class  or create another one


class Flyweight:
    def __init__(self, intrinsic_state):
        self.intrinsic_state = intrinsic_state

    def operation(self, extrinsic_state):
        # Use intrinsic and extrinsic states to perform the operation
        pass

class FlyweightFactory:
    flyweights = {}

    @staticmethod
    def get_flyweight(intrinsic_state):
        if intrinsic_state not in FlyweightFactory.flyweights:
            FlyweightFactory.flyweights[intrinsic_state] = Flyweight(intrinsic_state)
        return FlyweightFactory.flyweights[intrinsic_state]

A  = FlyweightFactory()
A.flyweights['a']->operation()


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to "minimize memory usage by sharing as much data(properties) as possible with other similar objects". It is often used when you have a large number of objects that are similar in nature and you want to reduce memory consumption by sharing data between them.

The Flyweight pattern has the following key components:

Flyweight: The interface or abstract class that defines the methods that a concrete flyweight class must implement.

Concrete Flyweight: The class that implements the Flyweight interface and provides the shared data.

Flyweight Factory: The class that manages the creation and storage of the flyweight objects.

Here is an example implementation of the Flyweight pattern in PHP:
