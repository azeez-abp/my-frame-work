/**
 * Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM 
 * by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

 * The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that 
 * aims to optimize memory usage by sharing common data across multiple objects
 * 
 * objects have two types of states:
 * Intrinsic State: This state is shared among multiple objects and remains constant throughout their lifecycle. 
 * It's the data that can be shared and reused.
 * Extrinsic State: This state varies among different objects and is usually supplied externally.
 * The Flyweight pattern suggests that you stop storing the extrinsic state inside the object. 
 * Instead, you should pass this state to specific methods which rely on it
 * 
 * Since the same flyweight object can be used in different contexts, you have 
 * to make sure that its state canâ€™t be modified.
 * 
 * This mehod is application when we are creating a number of obejects
 * 
 * shape : line (int, ext) , circle(int, ext) rect(int,ext)
 * 
 * we need diffent tyepes of object and 
 * Factory that will create and store them
