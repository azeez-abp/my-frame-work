The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes its state, all its dependent objects are notified and updated automatically. The pattern involves creating an object that maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes.
