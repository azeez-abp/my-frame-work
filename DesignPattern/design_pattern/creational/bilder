The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that 
"separates the construction of a complex object from its representation ". 
It allows you to create objects step-by-step, with the ability to customize their properties at each step. This can be particularly useful when constructing objects that require a large number of configuration options, or when creating objects that require certain dependencies to be injected at runtime
