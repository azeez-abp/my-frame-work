To assign licenses to users based on Azure AD attributes, you must create a dynamic security group and configure rules based on custom attributes. The dynamic group must be added to a license group for automatic synchronization. All users in the groups will get the license automatically. Azure AD evaluates the users in the organization that are in scope for an assignment policy rule and creates assignments for the users who don't have assignments to an access package; automatic assignment policies are not used for licensing.
