To allow traffic on port 8080 and view firewall rules, you'll need to use the appropriate commands for your operating system. Here are instructions for Linux (using `iptables` as an example) and Windows (using Windows Defender Firewall).

### Linux (iptables):

1. **Allow Port 8080**:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
   ```

   This command allows incoming traffic on port 8080.

2. **Save the Rules**:

   If you're using `iptables`, you'll need to save the rules to make them persist after a reboot:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
   ```

   Note: This command might vary depending on your Linux distribution.

3. **View Firewall Rules**:

   To view the current `iptables` rules, you can use:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -L
   ```

   This command will show you all the current rules.

### Windows (Windows Defender Firewall):

1. **Allow Port 8080**:

   ```cmd
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow Port 8080" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8080
   ```

   This command adds a rule to allow incoming traffic on port 8080.

2. **View Firewall Rules**:

   To view the current firewall rules in Windows Defender Firewall, you can use the Control Panel:

   - Open the Control Panel.
   - Go to "System and Security" > "Windows Defender Firewall".
   - Click on "Advanced settings" on the left-hand side.

   This will open the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security console, where you can view and manage rules.

Keep in mind that on Linux, there are various firewall management tools (`iptables`, `ufw`, etc.), so the commands might vary based on the specific tool you're using. The examples provided here are based on `iptables`. If you're using a different tool, let me know, and I can provide instructions accordingly.
