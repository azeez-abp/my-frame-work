To make a Virtual Machine (VM) in Oracle VirtualBox go full screen, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Virtual Machine**:

   Open VirtualBox and start the VM that you want to go full screen.

2. **Install Guest Additions**:

   - In the Virtual Machine window, go to the "Devices" menu.
   - Select "Insert Guest Additions CD image...".

   This will mount a virtual CD containing the Guest Additions on your VM.

3. **Install Guest Additions**:

   - Open a terminal or command prompt inside the VM.
   - Navigate to the mounted CD (usually under `/media` or `/mnt`). For example:
     ```bash
     cd /media/cdrom
     ```
   - Run the appropriate script to install the Guest Additions. On Linux, this is typically done with a command like:
     ```bash
     sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
     ```

   This will install the Guest Additions, which include drivers and utilities to improve the integration between the host and guest system.

4. **Reboot the VM**:

   After installing Guest Additions, reboot your VM.

5. **Adjust Screen Resolution**:

   - Once the VM has restarted, log in and go to the display settings (usually in system settings or display settings).
   - You should now be able to select higher resolutions, including your host machine's native resolution.

6. **Toggle Full Screen Mode**:

   - While the VM is running, you can toggle full screen mode by pressing `Host Key` + `F` (by default, the "Host Key" is Right Ctrl).

   Now, your Virtual Machine should be able to go full screen, adjusting to fit your monitor's resolution.

Please note that if the screen resolution doesn't adjust automatically, you might need to manually change it in the VM's display settings to match your host machine's resolution.
