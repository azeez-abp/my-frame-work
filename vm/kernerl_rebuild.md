Rebuilding the kernel on Ubuntu 22.04 involves a series of steps. Please note that kernel compilation is an advanced task and should be done with caution. It's recommended to perform these steps on a test system first.

Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Install Necessary Tools**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential flex bison libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libelf-dev libudev-dev libpci-dev libiberty-dev autoconf
   ```

2. **Download Kernel Source**:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/kernel
   cd ~/kernel
   wget https://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.15.6.tar.xz
   tar -xvf linux-5.15.6.tar.xz
   cd linux-5.15.6
   ```

3. **Configure the Kernel**:

   You can start with the existing configuration from your system:

   ```bash
   cp /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/.config .
   ```

   Then modify the configuration as needed:

   ```bash
   make menuconfig
   ```

   This will open a menu where you can customize the kernel options.

4. **Compile the Kernel**:

   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

   This will take some time. The `-j` flag specifies the number of parallel jobs to run. You can use `nproc` to automatically determine the number of processors.

5. **Install the Kernel**:

   ```bash
   sudo make modules_install install
   ```

6. **Update GRUB**:

   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   ```

7. **Reboot**:

   After the installation process completes successfully, you can reboot the system.

8. **Verify**:

   After rebooting, check that the new kernel is in use:

   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

Remember to be cautious while performing these steps, as compiling and installing a custom kernel can potentially lead to system instability if not done correctly. Always ensure you have a backup or a way to recover your system in case something goes wrong.
