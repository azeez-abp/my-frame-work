To add an environment variable in a Linux-based system, you have a few options. Here are some common methods:

1. **Temporary for Current Session**:
   - You can set an environment variable for the current session using the `export` command. This will only be effective for the current session and will be lost when you close the terminal.
   - Example: `export MY_VARIABLE="some_value"`

2. **For a Specific User**:
   - To set an environment variable for a specific user, you can add the export command to the user's profile file. This will make the variable available whenever that user logs in.
   - Common profile files include `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, etc., depending on the shell being used.
   - Example: Add `export MY_VARIABLE="some_value"` to `~/.bashrc`.

3. **System-wide for All Users**:
   - To set an environment variable system-wide, you can add it to a system-wide initialization file. This will make the variable available to all users on the system.
   - Common system-wide initialization files include `/etc/environment`, `/etc/profile`, `/etc/bash.bashrc`, etc., depending on the distribution.
   - Example: Add `MY_VARIABLE="some_value"` to `/etc/environment`.

4. **Using Shell Scripts**:
   - You can create a shell script that sets the environment variable and then execute that script. This will make the variable available in the current session.
   - Example script (`set_env.sh`):
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     export MY_VARIABLE="some_value"
     ```

   - Execute the script: `source set_env.sh` or `. set_env.sh`

5. **Using the `export` Command**:
   - You can use the `export` command directly in your shell to set an environment variable. This is temporary and will be available only for the current session.
   - Example: `export MY_VARIABLE="some_value"`

Remember to replace `MY_VARIABLE` with the actual name of your environment variable and `"some_value"` with the value you want to assign to it.

After setting an environment variable, you can access it in your shell scripts or commands using `$MY_VARIABLE`.
