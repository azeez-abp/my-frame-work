To see the amount of RAM (Random Access Memory) installed on your Linux system, you can use the `free` command or the `cat /proc/meminfo` command. Here's how you can do it:

### Using `free` command:

Open a terminal window and type the following command:

```bash
free -h
```

This will display the total, used, and free memory in a human-readable format.

### Using `/proc/meminfo`:

Open a terminal window and type the following command:

```bash
cat /proc/meminfo
```

This command will provide detailed information about memory usage, including total memory, free memory, and more.

### Additional Information:

- You can also use tools like `top`, `htop`, or system monitoring apps provided by your desktop environment to view memory usage in real-time.

- If you're interested in other system information, you can use commands like `uname -a` for kernel information or `lscpu` for CPU information.
