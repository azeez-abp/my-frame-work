In trees ADT (Abslraet Data Type), the order of lhc clements is not important. 
If we need ordering information linear data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, etc. ca n be used.

Compostion
Node
Edge (pointer from parent to child)
Children of same parent arc called siblings


The set of all node at a given  depth is called the level of the tree  and can be access through throgh dept first search

 depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to the node (count the number of Node)

 height of a node i s the length of the path from that node to the deepest node. (count the number of Node)

   The size of a node is the number(count number of node) of descendants it has including itself

   In a skew tree every node has one child
    left Skew
    right Skew
    left-right Skew
    Right-left Skew

The diameter of a tree (sometimes called the width) is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree.

Binary tree has max of two children
Strict Binary Tree => Every node has two children
Full Binary Tree: Every node has two children & all leave nodes are at the level 
 Node Number  =  ( 2^(h+1) - 1)  =>for Full Binary Tree
Complete Binary Tree :Every node has two children & with height diffent of h-1 (AVL prop)

Give an a lgorithm for finding the level that has the maximum sum in the binary tree bfs

Solution: The deletion of a node in binary tree can be implemented as
• Starting at root, find the node which we want to delete.
• find the deepest node in the tree.
• Replace the deepest node's data with node to be deleted.
• Then delete the deepest node 


The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf node.
