Two Pointers Technique
Two pointers  is typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array( input array is sorted.).
condition determine the movement of the pointer

From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms −

Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.

Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.

Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.

Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.

Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.



Algorithm Analysis
Efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed at two different stages, before implementation and after implementation. They are the following −

A Priori Analysis − This is a theoretical analysis of an algorithm. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by assuming that all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no effect on the implementation.

A Posterior Analysis − This is an empirical analysis of an algorithm. The selected algorithm is implemented using programming language. This is then executed on target computer machine. In this analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected.

O(n²) → Quadratic Time
In programming, many of the more basic sorting algorithms have a worst-case run time of O(n²):

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort


O(n log n)

* merge sort

* timsort

* heapsort


Most networking algorithms use the greedy approach. Here is a list of few of them −
